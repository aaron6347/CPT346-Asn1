KUALA LUMPUR: The government is prepared to face the eventuality of a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections following the Melaka polls last Saturday. Deputy health minister Aaron Ago Dagang said whether there would be an increase in infections could only be determined after 10 to 14 days. “We are monitoring the situation. The government is aware and ready to face the possibility of the fourth wave happening in the country,” he said during the question-and-answer session in the Dewan Rakyat today. He was responding to a supplementary question from Dr Kelvin Yii (PH-Bandar Kuching) on preparations by the government to face the eventuality of an increase in Covid-19 cases following last Saturday’s polls. Learning from the Sabah election last year, Aaron said strict SOPs were carried out for the Melaka elections by not allowing large-scale campaigns. He said similar SOPs would also be used for the coming Sarawak state polls to curb the spread of Covid-19.
