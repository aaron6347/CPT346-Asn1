KOTA KINABALU: The advice from a Sabah minister for the people, particularly those fully vaccinated, to strictly observe the SOPs seems to have fallen on deaf ears. Health data since Nov 13, when state local government and housing minister Masidi Manjun sounded the advice, has shown that more than half of the daily infections comprised patients who were fully vaccinated. Of the 5,076 people infected from Nov 13 to yesterday, 3,510 had received two doses of the vaccine. “Complacency among those fully vaccinated is quite alarming,” Masidi told FMT. “It could trigger a new wave of infections that would impact the capacity of our health services. “While those who are fully vaccinated may only suffer mild symptoms, they are nevertheless carriers of the virus that could infect others, including children who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated.” The Sabah Covid-19 spokesman added that people should take heed from the new wave of infection in many European countries triggered by complacency and refusal to adhere to SOPs and other public health advice. “As of yesterday, the national infectivity rate (R0) is 1.0 but for Sabah, this has gone up to 1.01. “The health director-general had subsequently reminded all citizens to continuously be on their guard to avoid another serious wave as before. Our attitude is the main factor in determining our success in fighting the virus,” he said. Sabah recorded 526 new infections in the past 24 hours, 41 more than yesterday.
