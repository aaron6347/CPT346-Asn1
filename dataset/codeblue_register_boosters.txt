KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 22 — Eligible Malaysians can start registering from today to walk in for their Covid-19 booster vaccine jab at a PPV near their residence. Click on ProtectHealth’s website here. Choose your state of residence from the dropdown menu under “Negeri”. Next, choose your city of residence from the dropdown menu under “Bandar”. For Kuala Lumpur residents, choose Kuala Lumpur. Key in your postcode. Although there is an option to key in your address under “Alamat”, do not fill in your address because that will severely limit the number of PPVs available. Just keying in your postcode is fine. No need to fill in anything under “Nama PPV”. Click “Cari”. A list of PPVs with their address, telephone number, and/ or email address should appear. Call or email your desired PPV and give them your name and contact details so that you can register on their waiting list. The PPV will call you to turn up to replace any no-shows. Currently, only Pfizer-BioNTech booster vaccines are provided at PPVs for free to certain individuals fully vaccinated with either Pfizer or Sinovac. Eligible priority groups are: Individuals aged 40 years and older; Individuals aged 18 and older with comorbidities; Staff and residents at long-term care facilities; Pregnant women; Those travelling abroad; Frontline workers from the health, security and defence sectors. If you belong to any of the groups above, you can register for your third vaccine dose on the 91st day onwards from your second Sinovac shot, or on the 181st day onwards from your second Pfizer shot. Register for your walk-in booster jab only if you have not received an appointment on MySejahtera.
