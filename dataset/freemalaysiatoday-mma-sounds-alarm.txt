PETALING JAYA: The rising Covid-19 infectivity rate and the increasing number of hospital admissions over the last week have made the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) sound the alarm, reminding the people not to be complacent. Its president, Dr Koh Kar Chai, said these, coupled with the recent trend in new cases surpassing recoveries, was something to worry about. He said the infectivity rate has increased to 1.04, the first time it had gone above 1.0 since Aug 31. “In view of this, we wish to remind Malaysians not to be complacent with the current situation as the infectivity rate remains high. Don’t let your guard down. “Do not be swayed by news that Malaysia is entering into an endemic phase. “It is already bad enough that our daily number of Covid-19 cases has started increasing again,” he said in a statement today. Nationally, the health ministry reported that the trend in hospital admissions, which had been declining for weeks, had reversed, increasing by 2.95% over the last seven days compared to the preceding week. The rise was largely contributed by Kuala Lumpur (+85.0%), Malacca (+41.2%), Negeri Sembilan (+20.4%), Perak (+16.4%) and Johor (+12.0%) during the stipulated period. Koh said it was disturbing that Terengganu was utilising 84% of its intensive care unit (ICU) beds. “Fatalities are still seen and for those who are fortunate to recover, there are many who need long-term medical treatment and rehabilitation after suffering from the damage done by the virus. “For those who are suffering from ‘long Covid’, depression sets in and takes away the desire to live. “The suffering of some of these survivors is something sobering that needs to be seen by those who believe that Covid-19 is not real,” said Koh. The health ministry reported 5,809 Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours. After four consecutive days of an increase in cases reported, today’s number is a decline from the 6,517 reported yesterday.
