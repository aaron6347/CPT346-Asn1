KUALA LUMPUR: The health ministry received 23,163 reports of adverse effects from those who had received Covid-19 vaccinations between February and Nov 20 this year, deputy health minister Aaron Ago Dagang said today. This was out of 51,842,386 doses of Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines administered during the same period. The number of reports amounted to 0.045% of all Covid-19 vaccine doses administered, he said. Of the number, 93.3% experienced light symptoms such as fever, headache and lethargy and recovered within a day. Another 1,549 reports – or 0.003% of the total vaccine doses – were received from people who suffered serious side effects. They were admitted to hospitals for several days for monitoring purposes, he said. Dagang also told the Dewan Rakyat that though 535 individuals who were fully vaccinated had died, post mortems showed that their deaths were not directly linked to the vaccines. He was replying to R Sivarasa (PH-Sungai Buloh), who asked the health ministry to state the number of vaccinated people who had suffered adverse effects. Sivarasa also urged the ministry to look at India, where reports said that millions of people in six states who were given Ivermectin at the initial stages of Covid-19 had recovered.
